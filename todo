=> Errors in child process ?
- If a dup2() call fails, an exception is thrown in the child process, and the father is hung
expecting input from stdin.
- if the execlp() call fails, we throw an exception in the child process. This should kill the
process and any call to write_line() or read_line() should throw IOErr()

=> Type safety
- Historically the board code was written in pure C, so enums are there to improve readability,
but they're really int (actually more often unsigned int).
- We need to introduce strong typing. Essentially Square, File, Rank, Piece, Color need to be
distinct types, so that common errors can be spotted by the compiler. Also thie allows better
blending of the C code base with all the new C++ hype.
