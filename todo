and depth should also depend on the color (asymetric SearchParam)

PGN
- Newline every N moves on PGN output
- Use a token type for SAN+depth+score in PGN. Print score and depth in PGN (with a bool option to
control it)

EPD:
- Choice between random and sequential mode (currently sequential)

Polyglot
- Import and adapt the Stockfish source
