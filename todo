=> Errors in child process ?
- If a dup2() call fails, an exception is thrown in the child process, and the father is hung
expecting input from stdin.
- if the execlp() call fails, we throw an exception in the child process. This should kill the
process and any call to write_line() or read_line() should throw IOErr()
