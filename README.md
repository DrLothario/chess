DiscoCheck
----------

DiscoCheck is a free UCI chess engine. It is not a complete chess program, but requires an UCI
compatible GUI in order to be used comfortably.

Terms of use
------------

DiscoCheck is free, and distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL). Essentially, this
means that you are free to do almost exactly what you want with the program, including distributing
it among your friends, making it available for download from your web site, selling it (either by
itself or as part of some bigger software package), or using it as the starting point for a software
project of your own.

The only real limitation is that whenever you distribute DiscoCheck in some way, you must always
include the full source code, or a pointer to where the source code can be found. If you make any
changes to the source code, these changes must also be made available under the GPL.

For full details, read the copy of the GPL found in the file named `./license`.

Enjoy!
